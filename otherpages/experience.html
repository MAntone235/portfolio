                With extensive experience in customer service, remote work, web development, graphic design, and management, I bring a well-rounded skill set to diverse professional settings. My customer service background has sharpened my communication and problem-solving abilities, while remote work has enhanced my time management and self-discipline. In web development, I focus on creating user-friendly websites with modern technologies, and my graphic design skills enable me to deliver visually compelling and brand-aligned designs. Additionally, my management experience has strengthened my leadership and organizational capabilities, allowing me to effectively guide teams and oversee projects. These combined skills drive my success in dynamic and fast-paced environments.

                    <p>
                        A group of Mentees from Indigenous Friends Association's Indigitech Program came together to conduct a case study involving access to traditional knowledge.

                    <p>
                        We came together as a group to define what we thought were the biggest issues with access to Traditional Knowledge.

                    <p>
                        We brainstormed Ideas on solutions to solve this ongoing issue. We decided on ways to gather research, deciding on interviewing participants.

                    <p>
                        We conducted youth interviews to gage the best way to deliver access. We came to the realization that online would be the best way to reach as many people as possible.
