          With extensive experience in customer service, remote work, web
          development, graphic design, and management, I bring a well-rounded
          skill set to diverse professional settings. My customer service
          background has sharpened my communication and problem-solving
          abilities, while remote work has enhanced my time management and
          self-discipline. In web development, I focus on creating user-friendly
          websites with modern technologies, and my graphic design skills enable
          me to deliver visually compelling and brand-aligned designs.
          Additionally, my management experience has strengthened my leadership
          and organizational capabilities, allowing me to effectively guide
          teams and oversee projects. These combined skills drive my success in
          dynamic and fast-paced environments.

                  A group of Mentees from Indigenous Friends Association's
                  Indigitech Program came together to conduct a case study
                  involving access to traditional knowledge.

                  We came together as a group to define what we thought were the
                  biggest issues with access to Traditional Knowledge.

                  We brainstormed Ideas on solutions to solve this ongoing
                  issue. We decided on ways to gather research, deciding on
                  interviewing participants.

                  We conducted youth interviews to gage the best way to deliver
                  access. We came to the realization that online would be the
                  best way to reach as many people as possible.

                  Together we came up with The Indigenous Cultural Bulletin! It
                  is an app that allows communities to post their events,
                  workshops and also teachings.Allowing all these things to be
                  available right at the tip of your fingers. With the world
                  becoming a tech led place this will allow all Indigenous
                  Communities all over the world to add their own page. Allowing
                  Communities to share their own events and also teachings that
                  is relevant to their own teachings and knowledge.

                  I collaborated with a small business to create and design a
                  logo, business cards, and also a business flyer. Along with a
                  Facebook banner for their business page. From start to finish
                  with some direction and colour outline I was able to create a
                  bright and vibrant design for Nish Nails
                </p>

                  I spoke with the owner and got an idea of what she was looking
                  for, and colours she was wanting to go with. I got to work
                  creating and designing allowing to combine all the proper
                  needed information.

                  With the flyer I wanted it to show the work they offer, along

                  appointment.

                  I then went on to create the Facebook Banner for their

                  display.

                  In this project, I crafted a comprehensive grant proposal for
                  RiseUp Youth Initiatives, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering
                  young people through targeted programs and support. My role
                  involved a deep dive into the intricacies of grant funding,
                  allowing me to gain valuable experience in the financial and
                  strategic aspects of nonprofit management.

              <h3>Basement Renovations</h3>
              <p>
                I volunteered my time and skills to a single mother to help renovate her basement space. I created two bedrooms in the space allowing there to be enough rooms to house her and her children.

              <h3>Wall Framing & Subfloor</h3>
              <p>
                I emptied the space out and allowing me to design the two rooms. I started with the framing wall to divide the room into two. Then I started to lay the subfloor.

              <h3>Drywall & Flooring</h3>
              <p>
                Once the framing and sub-floor was completed I then I completed the drywall on the walls and installed the flooring of her choice.

                      <p>
                        I then primed the walls and came up with a final design for the rooms.

                        I sat down with the family and we went over colour and design they were looking for in the rooms.
