                    Hello I'm Margaret, a creative Graphic Designer based out of London, Ontario. As a mother of 3 with a passion for creative design. I want to explore and create in all aspects of life. From creating and designing fun art projects with my children, to bringing my client's ideas to life. I enjoy all aspects of design from start to finish. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am very focused on giving my clients the end results they imagine!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have recently completed the INDIGItech program, a specialized initiative by the Indigenous Friends Association aimed at equipping Indigenous individuals with advanced skills in technology, coding, and digital literacy along with digital art. Currently, I am serving as an intern with the Indigenous Friends Association, where I am furthering my education and honing my expertise in Web Development.
